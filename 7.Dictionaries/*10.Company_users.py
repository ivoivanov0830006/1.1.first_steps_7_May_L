# ------------------------------------- Problem to resolve ------------------------------
#
# Write a program that keeps the information about companies and their employees.
# You will be receiving company names and an employees' id until you receive the command "End" command.
# Add each employee to the given company. Keep in mind that a company cannot have two employees with the
# same id.
# Print the company name and each employee's id in the following format:
# "{company_name}
# -- {id1}
# -- {id2}
# â€¦
# -- {idN}"
# Input / Constraints
# Until you receive the "End" command, you will be receiving input in the format:
# "{company_name} -> {employee_id}".
# The input always will be valid.
