# ------------------------------------- Another Solution -----------------------------
#
# phonebook = {}
#
# while True:
#     command = input().split("-")
#     if command[0].isdigit():
#         break
#     name, number = command[0], command[1]
#     phonebook[name] = number
#
# people_count = int(command[0])
#
# for _ in range(people_count):
#     person = input()
#     if person in phonebook.keys():
#         print(f"{person} -> {phonebook[person]}")
#     else:
#         print(f"Contact {person} does not exist.")


# ------------------------------------- Problem to resolve ------------------------------
# Write a program that receives info from the console about people and their phone numbers.
#
# Each entry should have a name and a number (both strings) separated by a "-". If you receive a name
# that already exists in the phonebook, update its number.
# After filling the phonebook, you will receive a number â€“ N. Your program should be able to perform a
# search of contact by name and print its details in the format: "{name} -> {number}". In case the
# contact isn't found, print: "Contact {name} does not exist."
# -------------------------------------- Example inputs ----------------------------------
# Input	                            Output
# Adam-0888080808                   Contact Mery does not exist.
# 2                                 Adam -> 0888080808
# Mery
# Adam
