# --------------------------- Problem to resolve ----------------------------

# As a gladiator, Peter needs to repair his broken equipment when he loses a fight.
# His equipment consists of a helmet, a sword, a shield, and an armor. You will receive
# Peter's lost fights count.
#   - Every second lost game, his helmet is broken.
#   - Every third lost game, his sword is broken.
#   - When both his sword and helmet are broken in the same lost fight, his shield also breaks.
#   - Every second time his shield brakes, his armor also needs to be repaired.
# You will receive the price of each item in his equipment. Calculate his expenses for the year
# for renewing his equipment.
# The input will consist of 5 lines:
#   - On the first line, you will receive the lost fights count â€“ an integer in the range [0, 1000].
#   - On the second line, you will receive the helmet price - a floating-point number in the range [0, 1000].
#   - On the third line, you will receive the sword price - a floating-point number in the range [0, 1000].
#   - On the fourth line, you will receive the shield price - a floating-point number in the range [0, 1000].
#   - On the fifth line, you will receive the armor price - a floating-point number in the range [0, 1000].
# Output
#   - As output, you must print Peter`s total expenses for new equipment:
#           "Gladiator expenses: {expenses} aureus"
