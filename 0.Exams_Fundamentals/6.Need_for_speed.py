# ------------------------------------- Problem to resolve -----------------------------------------
#
# On the first line of the standard input, you will receive an integer n â€“ the number of cars that you can
# obtain. On the next n lines, the cars themselves will follow with their mileage and fuel available,
# separated by "|" in the following format:
# "{car}|{mileage}|{fuel}"
# Then, you will be receiving different commands, each on a new line, separated by " : ", until the "Stop"
# command is given:
#   * "Drive : {car} : {distance} : {fuel}":
# You need to drive the given distance, and you will need the given fuel to do that. If the car doesn't have
# enough fuel, print:
#       "Not enough fuel to make that ride"
# If the car has the required fuel available in the tank, increase its mileage with the given distance,
# decrease its fuel with the given fuel, and print:
#       "{car} driven for {distance} kilometers. {fuel} liters of fuel consumed."
# You like driving new cars only, so if a car's mileage reaches 100000 km, remove it from the collection(s)
# and print:
#       "Time to sell the {car}!"
#   * "Refuel : {car} : {fuel}":
# Refill the tank of your car.
# Each tank can hold a maximum of 75 liters of fuel, so if the given amount of fuel is more than you can
# fit in the tank, take only what is required to fill it up.
# Print a message in the following format:
#       "{car} refueled with {fuel} liters"
#   * "Revert : {car} : {kilometers}":
# Decrease the mileage of the given car with the given kilometers and print the kilometers you have decreased
# it with in the following format:
#       "{car} mileage decreased by {amount reverted} kilometers"
# If the mileage becomes less than 10 000km after it is decreased, just set it to 10 000km and
# DO NOT print anything.
# Upon receiving the "Stop" command, you need to print all cars in your possession in the following format:
#       "{car} -> Mileage: {mileage} kms, Fuel in the tank: {fuel} lt."
