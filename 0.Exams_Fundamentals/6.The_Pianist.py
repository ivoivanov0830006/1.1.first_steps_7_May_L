# ------------------------------------- Problem to resolve ------------------------------
#
# On the first line of the standard input, you will receive an integer n â€“ the number of pieces you
# will initially have. On the next n lines, the pieces themselves will follow with their composer and key,
# separated by "|" in the following format: "{piece}|{composer}|{key}".
# Then, you will be receiving different commands, each on a new line, separated by "|", until the "Stop"
# command is given:
# "Add|{piece}|{composer}|{key}":
#       You need to add the given piece with the information about it to the other pieces and print:
#       "{piece} by {composer} in {key} added to the collection!"
#       If the piece is already in the collection, print:
#       "{piece} is already in the collection!"
# "Remove|{piece}":
#       If the piece is in the collection, remove it and print:
#       "Successfully removed {piece}!"
#       Otherwise, print:
#       "Invalid operation! {piece} does not exist in the collection."
# "ChangeKey|{piece}|{new key}":
#       If the piece is in the collection, change its key with the given one and print:
#       "Changed the key of {piece} to {new key}!"
#       Otherwise, print:
#       "Invalid operation! {piece} does not exist in the collection."
# Upon receiving the "Stop" command, you need to print all pieces in your collection in the following format:
#       "{Piece} -> Composer: {composer}, Key: {key}"
